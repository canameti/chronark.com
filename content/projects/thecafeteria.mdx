description: This is the website for an upcoming coffee shop in Berlin, designed to create anticipation and provide updates ahead of its grand opening. I developed the site to reflect the cafe’s modern, cozy vibe and to serve as a central hub for news, launch announcements, and community engagement. Currently in a "coming soon" phase, the website will go live with full features once the cafe opens its doors.
