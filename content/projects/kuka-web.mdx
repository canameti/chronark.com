The Kunstkarussell (KuKa) is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting artistic and cultural education, particularly for children and youth, while encouraging intergenerational and intercultural exchange. With a focus on holistic personal development, KuKa offers diverse activities like music, theater, dance, and creative workshops, as well as language courses for refugees, especially mothers with young children.

I am creating a modern, responsive website for Kunstkarussell using Next.js and TailwindCSS to showcase their mission, programs, and community impact. The site will feature an intuitive design, highlighting their events, volunteer opportunities, and ways to support their work, ensuring accessibility and engagement for a diverse audience.
